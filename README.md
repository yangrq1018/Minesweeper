# minesweeper
A Java minesweeper game running with a solver


### Update Jan 26th:
This version includes a new functionality of random try behavior upon the case that the solver is stuck. <del>This strategy is alike the normal behavior of human players.</del> Usually human players don't random click globally, instead they random pick in the area where the ambiguity arises.
